#Tools section
tools.titleGeneral = Tools
tools.Generaltext = In order to present information from different archival institutions in the Archives Portal Europe as consistent as possible, the project consortium has developed tools to enable the participating institutions to prepare the data they intend to display in this central online environment. These tools can be used via the backend of the central portal installation, to which all current partners have a personalised login, but standalone versions of these tools also are available to prepare the data locally. These standalone applications together with their corresponding manuals can be downloaded below. The tools will be further enhanced to better meet the needs of their users, therefore feedback is welcome to be sent via the
tools.contactform= contact form
tools.inpreparationforEuropeana=In preparation for Europeana
tools.inpreparationforEuropeana.text1=The project not only aims to build the Archives Portal Europe, but also cooperates with 
tools.europeana= Europeana 
tools.inpreparationforEuropeana.text2= to make archival material searchable and findable within its cross-domain approach of presenting cultural heritage objects from libraries, archives, museums, and audio-visual collections online. Therefore a tool has been developed to transform finding aids in the EAD format as it has been defined for the use within the Archives Portal Europe into records on digitised archival units encoded in the current Europeana metadata format ESE (Europeana Semantic Elements). In further development this tool will be adapted to support the new Europeana Data Model (EDM), which will be used in future Europeana portal releases.
tools.inpreparationforEuropeana.text3= To cope with the object-oriented approach of the ESE in comparison with the hierarchically structured, process-oriented approach of EAD the tool offers different possibilities to inherit information from higher description levels within the archival finding aids to the lower levels of its components. 
tools.inpreparationforEuropeana.text4=Furthermore the tool prepares all steps needed later on to link from the presentations of the described archival units to their digital representations at the content providers' websites.
tools.inpreparationforEuropeana.text5=Before providing the transformed data to Europeana, the user can check its future display using the tool's preview function, copying the Europeana HTML display offline. In this way, the content provider retains full control over the transformation process, until he is satisfied with the result.
tools.locallydifferent.text1 = Locally different, centrally joint
tools.locallydifferent.text2=The archives domain has long understood and appreciated the value of 
tools.standardisation = standardisation
tools.locallydifferent.text3=: the first international standard archival description, ISAD(G), was born in 1994, and has since been adopted by many archival institutions. The EAD format (Encoded Archival Description), which followed in 1998, has been equally successful as a useful method for on-line archival descriptions. Nevertheless the flexibility that allows EAD to fit to each national or local archival institution's needs and practises has also been a basis for heterogeneity within the boundaries of the standard. Hence, the variety of modes of production, of indexing and of display, when using EAD.
tools.locallydifferent.text4=The main goal of the Archives Portal Europe is to meet users' expectations by providing seamless access to various archival resources held throughout Europe. To achieve this, the project team developed a common European EAD-XML schema, that will act as a pivotal format additionally enabling the Archives Portal Europe to deliver standardised data to Europeana.
tools.locallydifferent.text5=The principle is simple: each partner will convert his/her data into this common format before integrating them in the portal, using the specific tool downloadable 
tools.here= here
tools.locallydifferent.text6 = . The realisation of this conversion and validation tool is based on the existing data provided by the partners, which is already structured in "local" EAD or drawn from databases etc compliant with ISAD(G).
tools.locallydifferent.text7=The tool thus relies on international standards and has developed a standard usable by all. Additional to EAD and ISAD(G), the standards EAC-CPF (based on ISAAR-CPF) to describe the records creators as well as EAG and ISDIAH to describe the archival institutions themselves are also taken into account.
tools.Standardisation = Standardisation
tools.localEADtoAPEnetEADtool= Data preparation tool

#About us section
aboutus.titleGeneral= About us
aboutus.GeneralText= The Archives Portal Europe is one of the main milestones achieved by the participants of the APEnet project supported by the European Commission in the eContentplus programme. The project's consortium currently consists of twelve national archives and national archives administrations, all of which are already represented within the Archives Portal Europe with parts of their archival material available to search online, as well as with additional information on the institutions themselves. Furthermore, five associated members have joined the project within its first two years and are also contributing to the growth of this Best Practice Network. Feedback and comments are welcome and can be sent via the
aboutus.contactform = contact form
aboutus.GeneralText2=. Those interested in more background information or in the possibility to participate in the project may refer directly to the project's website at:
aboutus.apeneteu = www.apenet.eu
aboutus.presentationofarchivalcontent=Presentation of archival content
aboutus.presentationofarchivalcontentText1=Finding aids can be consulted by following the navigated search approach within the 
aboutus.presentationofarchivalcontentText2=. This starts at the level of the countries and archival institutions themselves, represented by their holdings guides that provide an overview of the fonds and collections maintained by one archival institution.
aboutus.presentationarchivalcontent2= From there the finding aids are accessible as more detailed, hierarchically structured descriptions of the archival material including links to digitisations at the institutions' own websites.
aboutus.presentationarchivalcontent3=  The navigated search provides access to the constituent finding aid and allows the user to select and collect certain finding aids of interest for an overall search afterwards.
aboutus.contactdetailsandservices= Contact details and services
aboutus.contactdetailsandservicesText1=When archival material of interest for one's research has been identified and it comes to planning a visit on-site to consult the original material, the
aboutus.directorysection = Directory section
aboutus.contactdetailsandservicesText2=of the Archives Portal Europe - containing contact details and services offered by the different institutions - can be consulted. The directory not only includes those institutions already presenting their archival material in the Archives Portal Europe, but also other institutions from the participating countries whose content is not yet available in the portal.
aboutus.technicaldetails= Technical details
aboutus.technicaldetailsText1= The central and common data management and presentation of archival contents within the Archives Portal Europe are prepared via (de)centralised data processing. The participating institutions can decide themselves if they would like to use the tools for data preparation (ie conversion to and validation against the commonly used data formats) locally as desktop applications or as part of the central portal application, the dashboard. The tools have been developed - and will evolve further - in close cooperation with the project's partners, to whom they have already been distributed. The tools and the corresponding manuals can also be downloaded via the
aboutus.toolsSection=Tools section 
aboutus.technicaldetailsText2= International archival standards form the basis for data processing; finding aids and holdings guides are encoded according to EAD (Encoded Archival Description), while the descriptions of the archival institutions comply with EAG (Encoded Archival Guide). As the Archives Portal Europe expands in future, descriptions of the corporate bodies, persons, and families who created the archival material, will be added in compliance with EAC-CPF (Encoded Archival Context - Corporate Bodies, Persons, Families).
aboutus.technicaldetailsText3= Furthermore, the common use of EAD facilitates interoperability with 
aboutus.europeana = Europeana
aboutus.technicaldetailsText4=, making it possible for the participating institutions to deliver their content, if desired, to Europeana via the central tools as provided by the Archives Portal Europe.
aboutus.jointAccessToEuropeanaArchives=Joint access to European archives
aboutus.jointAccessToEuropeanaArchivesText1=Borders between European countries have changed often during the course of history. States have merged and separated and it is these changing patterns that form the basis for a common ground as well as for differences in their development. It is this tension between their shared history and diversity that makes their respective histories even more interesting. By collating archival material that has been created during these historical and political evolutions, the Archives Portal Europe aims to provide the opportunity to compare national and regional developments and to understand their uniqueness while simultaneously placing them within the larger European context. 
aboutus.jointAccessToEuropeanaArchivesText2=The portal will help visitors not only to dig deeper into their own fields of interest, but also to discover new sources by giving an overview of the jigsaw puzzle of archival holdings across Europe in all their diversity.
aboutus.combinedSearchFacilities= Combined search facilities
aboutus.combinedSearchFacilitiesText1=Within the Archives Portal Europe, the 
aboutus.advancedSearchSection = Advanced Search section
aboutus.combinedSearchFacilitiesText2= allows combined searches across national and regional materials. In addition to a simple full text search for content that can be precisely defined, the portal offers an advanced search option concentrating on certain aspects of the material such as the dates of creation and use. Furthermore, a navigated search allows users to browse through the archival material and thereby detect and explore contents of which they might not otherwise have been aware.
aboutus.combinedSearchFacilitiesText3=Users can avail of the three search options (simple full text search, advanced search and navigated search) in combination or separately, depending on their research needs.
aboutus.combinedSearchFacilitiesText4=Users have the same flexibility with regard to the presentation of search results which can be displayed according to the hierarchical structure of the archival material itself or as a summarised list of hits. Both options display the same search results and lead to more detailed descriptions of the corresponding archival units within the context of the finding aids.

#Finding aids and digitalizations section
digitalizations.questionGeneral =What to see at the Archives Portal Europe - presentation of archival content
digitalizations.answerGeneral =Archival fonds and collections are ordered according to the provenance principle: they are kept in one place and their arrangement is organised by the (archival) institution or individual that produced the documents (unlike the thematic organisation often to be found in libraries). The papers and files etc reflect the way an administration functions and are ordered in different collections, fonds, series or subseries. The finding aids, holdings guides and source guides are the tools produced to help the user understand this original ordering and to enable her/him to find and understand what s/he is looking for in the archival material.
digitalizations.titleHG =The holdings guides
digitalizations.answerHG =Whereas the finding aid contains detailed information about one specific fonds or (sub)series, a holdings guide gives an overview of all archival collections kept by an institution. The holdings guide provides only high level descriptions for each fonds or collection such as title, summary, dates and extent, and refers the user to the more detailed finding aids where they exist.
digitalizations.answerHG2 =Within the Archives Portal Europe, links to online finding aids accessible at the portal as well are indicated in the display of the holdings guide either by a small laptop icon or by text such as "Online finding aid" (or the corresponding term in the language of the content provider). Depending on the workflow of the constituent archival institutions, the holdings guides can be simple lists of the different fonds and collections, as well as a more elaborate, hierarchically-structured document. The latter can be following a chronological order (ie by era) or an administrative one (ie by provenance) or they can be a mix of both.
digitalizations.titleSG =The source guides
digitalizations.answerSG =The source guide is a particular form of finding aid. The objective is to track archival fonds and collections related to a specific topic either kept within one repository or dispersed between several institutions in one country or even in different countries and to gather their descriptions in order to facilitate research and access to the archives. The source guide presents the fonds, collections or items, and describes them by generally following the same rules as in a finding aid. It usually contains a short presentation of the particular institution(s) in addition to detailed administrative and historical presentations of the topic.
digitalizations.titleFA =The finding aids
digitalizations.answerFA=Although archival institutions produce specific finding aids to suit their own collections and users and although the content of a finding aid may differ depending on the type of material it is describing, the finding aids to be found in most archival institutions follow common and general rules to facilitate access to the archival material itself. Usually, a finding aid places the documents in the context of their origin and their initial and current use by giving information such as:
digitalizations.FApoint1=provenance, including historical, administrative or biographical information;
digitalizations.FApoint2 =acquisition and processing;
digitalizations.FApoint3=organisation and arrangement, including interrelationships with other fonds or records;
digitalizations.FApoint4=inventory of the series, subseries etc;
digitalizations.FApoint5=scope and content, including extent and physical description;
digitalizations.FApoint6=possible restrictions on use of or access to the documents due to archival law or data protection.
#digitalizations.FApoint7=Some of the finding aids also contain links to digitized on line document.
digitalizations.answerFA2=The finding aid thereby provides detailed, hierarchically-structured descriptions of the archival material itself and all the information required to order an archival document of special interest to you to consult it on-site. A certain number of finding aids furthermore includes digitisations of the archival material so that you can virtually browse through them directly from the Archives Portal Europe. 
digitalizations.answerFA3=At the Archives Portal Europe, digitised material can – depending on the type of analogue material – be recognised within the finding aids and in the search results display by small icons symbolising textual material, images, sounds or videos. The complete view of the finding aid may also contain thumbnails ie smaller representations of the digital object. Clicking an image type icon or a thumbnail will lead you to the full resolution of the digital object as displayed on the content provider's own website.

#Simple search information page
simpleSearchInfo.titleGeneral=The simple search
simpleSearchInfo.GeneralText =A simple full-text search can be initiated either at the homepage or within the section "Advanced search". In addition to entering a search term, you can also influence how the search is conducted by checking the boxes below the search field. It is, for instance, possible to concentrate your search on material with digital objects only. Equally, you can design your search more flexibly when searching for several search terms at once, but allowing a wider range of search results by checking the box to "Match at least one word".
simpleSearchInfo.options=The simple search options
simpleSearchInfo.GeneralText2=When using the "Match at least one word" option, you will not only get results with all your search terms found, but you will additionally be shown those results fitting only one of them. This functionality could be of particular help within a multilingual environment such as the Archives Portal Europe, since you could also enter the same search term in different languages or even different scripts.
simpleSearchInfo.GeneralText3 =Furthermore, you can define how the search results of a simple search shall be displayed. Checking the box "View in context" will lead to the search results being shown in the "Context view" ie within a tree structure starting at the level of the countries and drilling down via the institutions to their holdings guides and finding aids and the hits found therein. When conducting a simple search within the "Advanced search" section, you also have the option to select how many search results shall be displayed per page when looking at them in the "List view". The default setting is by 20 results per page which you could change to 10, 30, 50 or 100 hits per page (for details on the "List view" and the "Context view", please see 
simpleSearchInfo.link.searchResults = The presentation of search results
simpleSearchInfo.GeneralText4 =).
simpleSearchInfo.autocompletion=Autocompletion of the search term
simpleSearchInfo.GeneralText5 =When typing a search term (either for a simple search or in combination with any of the options in the "Advanced search" section), the Archives Portal Europe will provide you with suggestions on how to complete your search term. These suggestions are based on the content currently indexed and therefore searchable at the Archives Portal Europe, so the terms provided by this functionality are most likely to increase between your portal visits due to existing content being updated or new content being added regularly.
simpleSearchInfo.GeneralText6 =The autocompletion of search terms will start after you have entered at least two characters and it will be offered to you in form of a drop-down list of alternative terms expanding from the search box. The more characters you enter, the closer the suggested terms will probably get to your own search term. The autocompletion thereby is an optional service to indicate similar and related terms, that you probably would want to include in your research.
navigationguide.simpleSearch.download=Link to download text on simple searching

#Advanced search information page
advancedSearchInfo.titleGeneral=The advanced search
advancedSearchInfo.GeneralText =The "Advanced search" section of the Archives Portal Europe allows you to combine the simple full-text search with different options of concentrating your search on certain aspects. provides the possibility to either select certain institutions – and/or the countries where they are located – or to choose specific finding aids uploaded and indexed by these institutions. The lower part provides you with options to concentrate your search on specific types, elements and dates.
advancedSearchInfo.countriesArchives=Selecting countries and archives
advancedSearchInfo.GeneralText2=The tree structure starting at country level can be expanded – and collapsed – while browsing through it in order to get an overview of the content providers and their material. Beneath the country level, the constituent institutions will be grouped and listed according to the country’s administrative and/or regional structure (for details on ordering, see also the description of "
advancedSearchInfo.link.directoryInfo =The directory
advancedSearchInfo.GeneralText3="). For each institution you will then find its holdings guide, giving the titles of the archival fonds and collections in their context and hierarchical structure as well as including links to online finding aids that already are accessible within the Archives Portal Europe. In case no holdings guide exists yet for one institution or in case some finding aids are not yet included in the holdings guide, you could find those documents summarised as "Additional finding aids" in the tree.
advancedSearchInfo.GeneralText4=Clicking the title of a holdings guide or a finding aid within the tree structure will open the complete view of this document in a second display. You could therefore have a more detailed look before selecting a certain document for a search later on. To actively include one item from the tree structure in your search, you simply have to check the box on the left of the title of this item. This can be a single finding aid, a holdings guide with all finding aids linked therein, an institution with all its content or a whole country with all institutions participating.
advancedSearchInfo.GeneralText5=Having selected an item, this will be recognisable by a green checkmark in the box next to it as well as the title of the selected item being printed in green and italic. The boxes next to all levels above the selected item will furthermore be marked in green in order to point to an active selection even when the tree structure has been collapsed again.
advancedSearchInfo.GeneralText6=Deselection of previously included items is done the same way and you are free to mix selected countries, institutions, holdings guides and/or findings aids to best suit your (re)search topic and aim. You can conduct a search only by having selected one country or one institution and hitting the search button afterwards.
advancedSearchInfo.typesDates=Selecting types and dates
advancedSearchInfo.GeneralText7=The second part of the "Advanced search" section provides you with options to concentrate your search on either
advancedSearchInfo.typesDates.point1=a certain element of the descriptions of the archival material such as the title, the content summary or the reference code;
advancedSearchInfo.typesDates.point2=a certain type of document ie on "Only finding aids" or "Only holdings guides";
advancedSearchInfo.typesDates.point3=a certain time span.
advancedSearchInfo.GeneralText8=When selecting a specific element which you want to search, the search results will only include those hits where the search term has been found in the selected element. This can be advantageous in minimising the amount of possible search results when you already know more about your topic of interest and are already sure of a certain range of possible terms to be used in this context. These terms would then be most likely to appear already in the title of the archival descriptions or – as enlargement of the title – within the content summary. 
advancedSearchInfo.GeneralText9=Furthermore, this search option can be handy when you would already know the reference codes of those archival units of interest for your (re)search due to earlier findings either in an archival system or portal or for instance as a citation in secondary literature. By entering a concrete reference code as a search term and concentrating the search on the element "Reference code" only, you can pinpoint the corresponding archival description within the Archives Portal Europe.
advancedSearchInfo.GeneralText10=In case you have not made a selection on a certain element, the search will include all fields from the archival descriptions at once: title and content summary, reference code and descriptive dates as well as other descriptive information such as the records creator’s history or information on processing and arrangement and keywords provided by the archivist when creating the finding aid or holdings guide.
advancedSearchInfo.GeneralText11=Concentrating your search on either finding aids or holdings guides could be useful if you want to get a general overview of archival material existing on a certain topic, which you could most easily get by starting your research on holdings guide level only. This would probably make the amount of search results that you would get in the first place more concrete and therefore easier to be evaluated in order to conduct the next steps ie selecting specific finding aids on the fonds and collections of interest you have found described in the holdings guide.
advancedSearchInfo.GeneralText12=For the search on dates, you can decide on either searching with an earliest date or a latest date only or searching within a certain time range. As for selecting one country or one institution in order to search all content provided by them, you also can search date-based material only, ie without additionally entering a specific search term. This would especially be useful if you would like to know more about administrative material having been created at a certain period of time.
advancedSearchInfo.GeneralText13=You can combine all search options best fitting your field of interest and (re)search. In addition, the advanced search options can also be used for enhancing a first search based on the results found and in order to concentrate the results on those you are mainly be interested in.  
navigationguide.advancedSearch.download=Link to download text on advanced searching

#Search results information page
searchResultsInfo.titleGeneral=The presentation of search results
searchResultsInfo.GeneralText =Irrespective of whether you have conducted a simple full-text search, a navigated search or an advanced search, the search results will always be displayed in the same two views, from which you are again free to choose the one best fitting your purpose. After a search, the page will start with the search results as the main part. In any case, the scroll bar at the right of the browser window will allow you to access the advanced search options as well as the search field in case you wish to either check or change your search settings.
searchResultsInfo.autosuggestion=Autosuggestion of alternative terms
searchResults.GeneralText2=At the top of the search results, you will most likely find some alternative terms for your search being suggested. Similar to the autocompletion of the search term, these suggestions are based on the indexed content of the Archives Portal Europe and provide you with up to five alternative terms having more possible hits in the search index than the search term you had provided initially. Again, this can be useful for detecting similar or same terms in different languages but can also indicate alternative terms more frequently used in the archival content than might not have been previously thought of. Autosuggestion furthermore is of help with regard to possible typos to which you will be alerted by the question "Do you mean?" being displayed in front of the suggested terms.
searchResultsInfo.listView=The "List view"
searchResults.GeneralText3=The default display for the search results themselves will be the "List view" where the title of the single search result, an extract of its description, its date of creation, its reference code as well as the title and identifier of the finding aid or holdings guide containing the search result, will be specified. Furthermore, the host archival institution and the country where this institution is located, will be mentioned and an image icon for textual material, images, sound or videos will indicate existing digital objects.
searchResults.GeneralText4=You can customise the display slightly by changing the amount of results shown per page and you can browse through the different search results pages either via the arrows at the top right of the list or by directly heading for a specific page via entering the page number in the field "Go to page" and hitting the return key.
searchResults.GeneralText5=While the sequence of the "List view" by default is according to the relevance of the term found in relation to your search term, you can also rearrange the results in this view either by date, alphabetically by the title of the single hits, by their reference codes or by the identifier of the finding aid or holdings guide to which they belong. Sorting by reference code will be done separately for each finding aid respectively for each holdings guide and therefore already includes a type of sorting by "finding aid number".
searchResults.GeneralText6=Note: When sorting alphabetically by title, the list might start with titles including special characters like brackets, dots or numbers. To get to the first title starting with an "A" you might want to browse forward through the search results pages in such a case.
searchResults.GeneralText7=In addition to sorting your search results, the "List view" also includes a functionality to refine your search results by country, by archival institution, by type of document, by dates or by the aspect of the search results containing digital objects respectively by the type of these digital objects themselves. Starting with the facet having the most hits in each refinement category, at the first glance up to 10 facets each will be displayed. If more than 10 different facets are included, you will find a "More..." button at the bottom of the refinement in question in order to expand the complete list.
searchResults.GeneralText8=Note: For refinement by date, you have different possibilities depending on the kind of date information included in the archival material. The category "Date types" will offer "Full dates", the amount of which corresponds to the sum of the categories "Start timespan" and "End timespan" that you find below. These three facets all refer to technically processible date information, normalised according to ISO standard 8601. \nThe facet "Only descriptive dates" comprises those cases where the archival material does contain information on dates but this could not be normalised easily. Examples of this include medieval charters containing the date information as written textual information in Latin or archival material not containing concrete enough date information, which might result in entries like "without date" or similar. \nContrary to the latter example, the facet "No date specified" summarises all archival material where no date information is given at all due to a variety of possible reasons.
searchResults.GeneralText9=While refinement by country and institution is a reference to the advanced search when selecting countries and/or archives, refinement by type of document and by date corresponds to the according advanced search options for selecting types and dates. Finally, refinement by digital objects corresponds to having the checkbox for "Only material with digital objects" checked when doing your search.
searchResults.GeneralText10=To see some more information on constituent results in the "List view", you can activate a brief preview display by hovering above the right end of the search result. The preview can be printed and provides you with access to the presentation of the search results within their complete context that will open in a second browser tab or window. This second display can also be accessed by clicking the title of one search result in the "List view".
searchResultsInfo.contextView=The "Context view"
searchResults.GeneralText11=Alternatively, you can look at the single hits in the "Context view" where you will find them grouped by the document to which they belong. The expandable tree in the "Context view" – similar to the one in the advanced search options – starts at country level and leads via the constituent institutions to these institutions’ holdings guides and finding aids. Being a search results display, the "Context view" will of course only show those countries, institutions, holdings guides and finding aids where the search term has been found fitting other search settings chosen in the advanced search options.
searchResults.GeneralText12=The different levels will all be ordered within the tree structure by amount hits, starting with the country, institution and finding aid containing the most search results. If there are hits within the holdings guide of one institution as well as in some of this institution’s finding aids, the holdings guide will always be listed first. Within the holdings guide and finding aids, the constituent search results are then sorted according to the immanent hierarchical structure of the document itself.
searchResults.GeneralText13=To the right of each level within the tree structure of the "Context view", the number of search results included in this level will be given. By expanding the tree step by step, you can drill down to the constituent hits which will be indicated as active links printed in blue. Clicking the title of one search result will open a preview similar to the one available in the "List view". This preview again can be printed and provides access to the complete finding aid or holdings guide which will open exactly at the place within this document where your search term has been found. 
searchResultsInfo.completeContext=View the search results in their complete context
searchResults.GeneralText14=By clicking the title of a search result of your interest in "List" tab via the preview shown in either "List" tab or "Context" tab, you will open the complete finding aid or holdings guide in a new tab or window of your browser. 
searchResults.GeneralText15=On the right of this second display, all information available on a specific archival unit will be given so that you learn more about the file you found in order to decide if it really fits your (re)search aim and topic. In addition to this, the tree structure on the left allows you to also explore the search result’s original context when browsing the complete hierarchy and thereby discover related resources that might also be of interest to you.
searchResults.GeneralText16=Provided the material is digitised and accessible online, digital objects will be indicated in the second display either via the small image icons or via a thumbnail, in case the link to that had been delivered already by the content provider. Icons as well as thumbnails will lead you to the full resolution of the digital object as displayed on the content provider’s own website to explore further.
searchResults.GeneralText17=Note: When a finding aid or a holdings guide is being updated by the content provider, it may happen that the second display for this document is temporarily unavailable even though you still could search for – and find – archival material described in the Archives Portal Europe. In such cases, accessing the second display will result in a message asking you to please try again later. Incidents such as this should be resolved within 24 hours at the latest.

additionalInfo.GeneralText =Once you have found some material of interest, you will find all the necessary information to contact the institution holding and maintaining these materials in the "Directory“ section. Here you have a list not only of all archival institutions already providing content to the Archives Portal Europe, but also some information on other archival institutions from the participating European countries. The tree structure of the directory is ordered firstly by country and within each country, the single institutions are displayed by the administrative and/or regional order as provided by the national archival institutions themselves.
additionalInfo.GeneralText2 =Clicking on the name of an institution on the left will display on the right the information currently available for this institution such as contact details (telephone numbers and (e)mail addresses etc) or a link to the institution’s own website with further and more detailed information.

The content of these information pages themselves might be given in the official language of the country where the institution is located, but the headers and labels will be displayed in the language you have chosen for the portal’s user interface.  
additionalInfo.GeneralText3 =In addition to those institutions participating already in the Archives Portal Europe, the directory also provides access to information on other archival institutions within the partner countries. This information is made available via existing national and regional archival portals that act as access points to more archival material online.
additionalInfo.GeneralText4 =For a general overview of the European archival landscape, a map is included at the bottom of the "Directory" section as a comprehensive visual guide to the archival resources in Europe. It provides information on the location of the participating institutions at one glance and clicking on the constituent pins will show additional information on their contact details. The blue pins indicate those institutions that deliver content to the Archives Portal Europe while the red pins redirect to national and regional portals that extend the data provided via Archives Portal Europe towards a useful virtual repository of European archival portals.
