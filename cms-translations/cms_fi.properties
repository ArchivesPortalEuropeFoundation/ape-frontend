help.titleGeneral=Are you lost? Here is the right place to be!
help.text1=People get lost sometimes, but it is not your fault. We help you to navigate our website.
help.text2=Select what you would like to do in the menu, then the problem will be solved!
help.searching.titleGeneral=Tervetuloa Euroopan Arkistoportaaliin
help.searching.subtitle1=Three sources
help.searching.text1=There are three sources of content in the portal:
help.searching.list1.part1=1) Archival materials ("archives") consisting of administrative records, documents, letters, maps, manuscripts, books and photos etc that you can consult in archival institutions. The information is provided in the form of 
help.searching.list1.link=finding aids, holdings guides and source guides
help.searching.list1.part2=, which provide information about those materials. 
help.searching.list2=2) Information about person, family and corporate body entities ("names") such as Galileo Galilei, House of Habsburg and the East India Company. This source offers a new way of exploring a wide range of archival information. You can access archival materials through their creators or associated entities and you may find previously unknown relationships between the archives and entities. 
help.searching.list3=3) Information about archival institutions in Europe. This is an extra source to find information about the institutions, which hold archival materials, as contact and service information is essential for your visit and consultation. You can also find further information such as the list of finding aids and holdings guides that an institution already has made available at the Archives Portal Europe.
help.searching.text2=Are you interested in the data standards used for these contents? You can find more information on our 
help.searching.text2.link=Projektin verkkosivu
help.searching.subtitle2=Simple search
help.searching.text3=This is the most popular way of searching the content. You can simply type keywords in the search box on the home page or on the search page.
help.searching.image1=Simple search and autocompletion
help.searching.text4=When typing the keywords, you will see some suggestions of terms with an indicator of the number of results. The suggestions when searching from the homepage also refer to what sources the results are from (archives, names and institutions).
help.searching.subtitle3=Tarkennettu haku
help.searching.text5=For more experienced users, we provide advanced search options when searching in each of the three sources (archives, names, and institutions) separately. There are two or three blocks of options (see block 1, 2, and 3 in the image below) depending on the type of source. 
help.searching.text6=Below the search box (block 3), you will find three options. "View result(s) in context" will open the context view in the first place when searching in archives. "Match at least one word" will return results containing just one of several words. This is equivalent to the Boolean operator OR, widening your search results. This search can be useful when using variations of keywords at once, for example, in multiple languages. "Only material with digital objects" is convenient when you are only interested in archives containing digital objects such as scanned letter and photographs. 
help.searching.text7=Search in archives
help.searching.text8.part1=In block 1, you can select countries, archives and single holdings, for which you would like to execute a search, from a hierarchically structured list. In block 2, you can specify element (Title, Content summary, Reference code), 
help.searching.text8.link=document type
help.searching.text8.part2=(Only finding aids, Only holdings guides, Only source guides) and the dates of your search. When you are interested in specific dates, the "Exact date search" option is handy.
help.searching.text9=Search in names
help.searching.text10=There are only blocks 2 and 3. In block 2, you can specify element (Name, Identifier, Place, Occupation, Mandate, Function), entity type (Person, Family, Corporate body) and the date of your search.
help.searching.text11=Search in institutions
help.searching.text12=There are only blocks 2 and 3. In block 2, you can specify the type of archives as well as the element (Only name, Only place).
help.searching.image2=Browse, select and specify your interest using the advanced search options
help.search-results.titleGeneral=Search results
help.search-results.subtitle1="1st display"
help.search-results.text1=A query will return all the results from three different sources ("1st display"). Unless already specified, the results from archives will be presented in a simple list view. By clicking one of the tabs at the top you can switch to the results from one of the other sources.
help.search-results.image1=Find search results in three sources (archives, names and institutions)
help.search-results.text2=When looking at search results in archives you can select either list view or context view. By default the list view is shown.
help.search-results.text3=The context view is just another way to see the results in the hierarchical structure of the archives. Therefore, the number of results is exactly the same as the one you see in the list view. You may understand the results better in the context view because you can look at the single hits grouped by the document to which they belong. It also provides more background information in a broader context.
help.search-results.text4=Sometimes your search terms are found several times within a finding aid. You can exclude other finding aids and focus on a particular one by using the "View only results from this finding aid" button found next to a search result.
help.search-results.image2=Switching between list view and context view
help.search-results.text5=You can refine the search results in archives by check marking the boxes on the left by:
help.search-results.list1.part1=Country (Iceland, Slovenia etc) 
help.search-results.list1.part2=Archival institution (National Archives of Estonia, Stadtarchiv Montabaur etc)
help.search-results.list1.part2a=Topic (Charters, Maps, First World War, Education etc)
help.search-results.list1.part3=Document types (Finding aid, Holdings guide, Source guide)
help.search-results.list1.part4=Level (Other descriptions, Fonds description)
help.search-results.list1.part5=Contains digital objects
help.search-results.list1.part6=Digital object type (Image, Text, Sound, Video, 3D or unspecified)
help.search-results.list1.part7=Language of description (Italian, Greek etc)
help.search-results.list1.part8=Date types (Full date, Only descriptive date, no date specified)
help.search-results.list1.part9=Start and end timespan (1600â1799 etc)
help.search-results.text6=Remember that you can select your interests from different filters (eg Iceland from Country and Image from Digital object type), and select more than one from one filter (eg Iceland and Slovenia from Country) except Start and end timespan.
help.search-results.image3=Refinement options to narrow your search results
help.search-results.text7=You can sort the results by Date, Title, Reference code and Finding aid number.
help.search-results.text8=In the tab for search in names, there are different refinement options by:
help.search-results.list2.part1=Country (Iceland, Slovenia etc) 
help.search-results.list2.part2=Archival institution (National Archives of Estonia, Stadtarchiv Montabaur etc)
help.search-results.list2.part3=Type of entity (Person, Family or Corporate body)

help.search-results.list2.part7=Function (geologist, nobles etc)
help.search-results.list2.part8=Language of description (Italian, Greek etc)
help.search-results.list2.part9=Date types (Full date, Only descriptive date, Unknown date, Timespan with unknown start date, Timespan with unknown end date)
help.search-results.list2.part10=Start and end timespan (1600â1799 etc)
help.search-results.text9=In the tab for search in institutions, there are different refinement options by:
help.search-results.list3.part1=Country (Iceland, Slovenia etc)
help.search-results.list3.part2=Archival landscape (State Archives in Poznan, archives dÃ©partementales etc)
help.search-results.list3.part3=Type of archive (Regional archives, specialised governmental archives etc)
help.search-results.image4=To see a digital object, find an icon. Preview shows the summary of a result
help.search-results.text10=An icon may be displayed in a result in the list view for archives when digital objects are available. You can also check a preview to see the summary of the result. The Save search option for searching in archives is only possible when you create your own account. When saving, search settings (refinement and sorting) will be also preserved.
help.search-results.subtitle2="2nd display"
help.search-results.text11=When you click one of the results, a new window/tab will open to view the full detail of the result with the keywords highlighted ("2nd display") on the right pane for archival material. From here you can also share, bookmark and print information. The left pane shows the complete contextual structure of the record (ie the hierarchy within finding aid, holdings guide or source guide). When available, digital object icons and thumbnails are clickable to go to the website of the archival institution, which holds the document in question. At the bottom, you may want to send feedback to the institution.
help.search-results.image5=2nd display of a finding aid with digital objects as well as sharing, print and feedback functionalities
help.search-results.text12=When accessing the result of a search in names, the "2nd display" sports information on related sources on the right and in addition to the full detail of the result. These relations are grouped by archival materials created by or referencing the described person, family or corporate body, by related entities and by archives that hold the related materials. There also might be a relation to alternative descriptions of the same entity eg in other languages.
help.search-results.text13=The "2nd display" for institutions is divided in an upper part showing a map and a lower part giving the full detail of the result.
help.search-results.text14=The "2nd display" of all sources also allows you to start a new search in all content directly from here.
help.search-results.image6=2nd display for the description of a corporate body with related sources and option for a new search
help.topics.titleGeneral=Searching with topics
help.topics.text1=Along with the simple search, the Archives Portal Europe's homepage offers you access to the archival material based on topics. These topics can cover aspects of content (Education, Justice, Economics etc), certain periods in time (Medieval period, First World War (1914-1918) etc) or the genre of the material (Charters, Maps, Photography etc). The topic cloud on the homepage shows 15 alternating topics, while a link below them ("View all our topics") leads to a separate page listing all topics that are currently connected to the archival material provided by our partners.
help.topics.image1=Topic cloud on the Archives Portal Europe's homepage
help.topics.text2.part1=When clicking a topic you will be led to the relevant search results of archives linked to the topic of your choice. The search results will be displayed in the same way as after performing a simple search - that means in the list view - and you will have the usual options to refine the search results (see details for the "Search results" presentation
help.topics.text2.link=täältä
help.topics.text2.part2=). The topic that you have selected will be highlighted and displayed directly beneath the search field (see number 1 in the screenshot below). There might also be further topics connected to the same material which will then be shown as normal refinement options (see number 2 in the screenshot below).
help.topics.text3=Tip: It is also possible to use search terms to make a query within a topic. Remove the * from the search box, type your keywords, and hit the search button. Remember to keep the topic button beneath the search box as is.
help.topics.image2=Search results for a topic based search (example: "Architecture")
help.topics.text4=Topics are a way to combine archives from different countries and content providers based on a common theme or genre or time. Therefore, the topic term itself does not necessarily appear in the archives' descriptions, but there is a general relation between the archives and the topic. Note that topics are currently only connected to the archival material, which means they will only show in the tab "Search in archives". Switching to one of the other tabs will keep the search term, but it will lose all other content type related aspects of the search, including the topics.
help.finding-institutions.titleGeneral=Finding archival institutions
help.finding-institutions.link1=The Directory 
help.finding-institutions.text1=offers information about institutions holding and maintaining archival materials. It should be noted that the Directory includes institutions not yet publishing archival materials on the portal.
help.finding-institutions.text2=There are two ways to navigate. If you use the map, you can zoom in and out to narrow down a region of your interest until you find an institution for which the main contact information becomes available when clicking one of the markers on the map. The other way is to use a list of institutions sorted by country. When you select a country in the list, the map automatically shows the area too. Be aware that some countries are organised by type of institutions while others are organised by region or administrative structure. 
help.finding-institutions.text3.part1=You can find information including contact details, opening hours, available services and the list of 
help.finding-institutions.link2=finding aids and holdings guides 
help.finding-institutions.text3.part2=already available on the portal.

help.signing.image2=Bookmarking a page of interest and adding the bookmark to a collection
help.signing.subtitle3=Collections
help.signing.text4=You may want to better organise your saved searches and bookmarks in collections.

# -- New text for "About us" section --
aboutus.titleGeneral=Meistä
aboutus.text1=We are a passionate international team working to create a one-stop web service to make European archives as accessible as possible. Colleagues from all over Europe work together very closely to make this dream come true. Previously, users had to visit various archival websites for their research but now the Archives Portal Europe enables them to find information more efficiently from millions of archival materials stored in hundreds of archival institutions using a single online access point. This is the first time European archives have collaborated on this scale and the potential that these connections provide is enormous for both archives professionals and users.
aboutus.textGeneral2=The Archives Portal Europe is one of the main milestones achieved by the projects APEnet and APEx - supported by the European Commission since 2009 - in which, by September 2015, more than 30 project partners representing a corresponding number of European countries have participated. From October 2015 onwards, the Archives Portal Europe will be maintained and developed further by the Archives Portal Europe Foundation, now financially independent and supported by the national archives of the participating countries. Those interested in more background information or in the possibility to participate in the portal or the foundation may refer directly to the foundation's website at:
development.titleGeneral=Power of development
aboutus.textGeneral3=The Archives Portal Europe has been created and enhanced through years of collective development. In particular, we have made considerable efforts to implement standardisation with common European profiles of the international XML schemas EAD (Encoded Archival Description), EAC-CPF (Encoded Archival Context - Corporate Bodies, Persons and Families), EAG (Encoded Archival Guide) and METS (Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard) and to create tools to manage and publish complex data from a wide range of archives across Europe.
aboutus.textGeneral4a=The principle is simple: each partner converts his/her data into this common format before integrating it in the portal using the  
# -- tools.here=here --
aboutus.link.DPT=local Data Preparation Tool
aboutus.textGeneral4b=or the online tool available in the portal's backend. The realisation of this conversion and validation tool thus relies on international standards and the project has developed profiles of these usable by all.
tools.inpreparationforEuropeana=Valmistelu Europeanaa varten
aboutus.textGeneral5=The Archives Portal Europe also cooperates with

aboutus.textGeneral6=to make archival material searchable and findable within its cross-domain approach of presenting cultural heritage objects online from libraries, archives, museums and audio-visual collections.
